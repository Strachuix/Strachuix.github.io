This is a project that came to me because I didn't want to replicate the same ToDo App concept, so I decided to look at it from a different angle. 
I used JS and localStorage and the ability to write and read the transferred files.
This way, we have a list of tasks that can be freely exported in json format and used as needed in other apps.
The storage is done on the users' devices, and if they want to keep the tasks for a longer period of time, they have to download a small task file which they can also edit manually, making it quicker to enter data into the application.
From a technical point of view, it's an app that displays in a neat way and allows you to edit the json file.
In the future, I plan to add a timetracker or something similar.
